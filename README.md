# Operational Risk Analysis for Financial Transactions

### Overview
This project focuses on identifying operational risks in financial transactions using predictive modeling and data analysis techniques. The aim is to reduce risks such as fraud, compliance failures, and transaction errors by leveraging machine learning models and visualization tools.

---

## Project Description
Financial institutions handle millions of transactions every day, and mitigating operational risks such as fraud, transaction failures, and non-compliance is crucial. This project uses data analytics and machine learning techniques to:
- Identify common risk patterns in transaction data.
- Build models to predict high-risk transactions.
- Visualize risk distribution and trends over time.

---

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Transaction data is preprocessed for missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries.
- **Risk Identification**: Data is analyzed to extract features related to potential risks, such as unusual transaction amounts or frequency.
- **Predictive Model**: We built and compared different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict high-risk transactions.
- **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards using Tableau/Python to showcase risk insights.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: For data processing, feature engineering, and model building.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Libraries used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Applied machine learning algorithms for classification.
- **SQL**: Querying data from a relational database.
- **Tableau**: Visualized risk trends and distribution.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and sharing analysis interactively.

## Dataset
The dataset includes transaction data from a financial institution (or simulated). Key features include:
- **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Transaction Amount**: Value of each transaction.
- **Transaction Time**: Time at which the transaction was processed.
- **Transaction Type**: Type of transaction (e.g., credit, debit, online payment).
- **Account Holder Info**: Details about the account involved in the transaction.
- **Risk Label**: Whether the transaction was flagged as risky (for supervised learning).

## Results
- **Risk Prediction**: Achieved an accuracy of 85% using the Random Forest model to predict risky transactions.
- **Feature Importance**: Transaction amount, time of day, and transaction frequency were the most important predictors of risk.
- **Visualization**: Risky transactions were mapped and analyzed over time using Tableau to identify patterns and clusters.

---

## Future Improvements
- **Model Tuning**: Further optimize the models by tuning hyperparameters and testing additional algorithms.
- **Real-time Risk Detection**: Extend the project to include real-time monitoring and flagging of risky transactions.
- **Additional Features**: Include more detailed customer behavior data to improve risk detection accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of data-driven approaches to operational risk management in the financial sector. By identifying risk patterns early, financial institutions can mitigate losses and enhance their transaction processes.
